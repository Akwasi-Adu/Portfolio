Every registered version of the Pastel Partner Software comes with a specific user license. This error means you have exceeded the number of users who are registered to log onto the system concurrently.
</p><p>
If you are getting this error message despite having the appropriate number of users access the system, then a common cause could be that Pervasive hasn’t been licensed and the temporary has expired or you are running on the temporary license (one user).
</p><p>
To confirm if you have the correct number of users licenced, go to Start &gt; All Programs &gt;Other Utilities &gt; License Administrator.
This opens the Pervasive Licence Administrator Tool which should show you all existing Pervasive Licenses with details of the number of users and date of expiry.</p>

<p>If the License Administrator is not showing the right number of users you are licensed for, try re-registering Pastel. You could also enter your server name in the computer name field and click ‘connect’ to pull the correct license details from the server.
</p><p>
Another common cause of this error for clients running on Pervasive Workgroup versions is that one of the workstations in the workgroup with inaccurate license details (e.g. 1 user count) has logged into the system first and is locking out all other users. To confirm this, you could open the pastel company folder and search for the .LOC file. Open the .LOC file in notepad and you should see the name of the offending workstation. 
</p><p>
One way to avoid this is to use the Gateway Locator tool to assign ownership of the various Pastel Partner company databases to the server and to make sure that the server has the right license info.</p>
<p></p>

<img src="/portfolio/images/blog/1612.png" alt="screenshot">
<p>To do this, go to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Other Utilities &gt; Gateway Locator.
Click on the button at the end of the Target Directory textbox to browse to and select the appropriate pastel company database. Click on the change button and enter the server name in the “Assign a Gateway” field  and click “Ok”

Do let me know if I could be of any further help, in the comments section.

Cheers!</p>
