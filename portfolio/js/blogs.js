        <p>The infamous Pastel Error Code 20 when starting Pastel Partner.</p>
<p>
This is one of the rather common error codes that Pastel Partner users commonly encounter.
The error simply means the pervasive engine is not running.
One way of avoiding this error is to install pervasive as a service rather than an application that shows up in the system tray or notification area.
</p><p>
Follow the following steps to resolve the issue:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Check the system tray to see if pervasive database pre-load icon is showing</li>
<li>If not, start pervasive manually by going to Start > All Programs > Pervasive > Engines > Start Workgroup Engine</li>
<li>Try running Pastel again</li>
<li>If error persists, you might have to uninstall and reinstall pervasive again.</li>
</ol></p><p>

        content:`<p>Error Code 161 means you have exceeded your pervasive user count. 
Every registered version of the Pastel Partner Software comes with a specific user license. This error means you have exceeded the number of users who are registered to log onto the system concurrently.
</p><p>
If you are getting this error message despite having the appropriate number of users access the system, then a common cause could be that Pervasive hasn’t been licensed and the temporary has expired or you are running on the temporary license (one user).
</p><p>
To confirm if you have the correct number of users licenced, go to Start > All Programs >Other Utilities > License Administrator.
This opens the Pervasive Licence Administrator Tool which should show you all existing Pervasive Licenses with details of the number of users and date of expiry.</p>

<img src="portfolio/images/blog/161.png" alt="screenshot" />

<p>If the License Administrator is not showing the right number of users you are licensed for, try re-registering Pastel. You could also enter your server name in the computer name field and click ‘connect’ to pull the correct license details from the server.
</p><p>
Another common cause of this error for clients running on Pervasive Workgroup versions is that one of the workstations in the workgroup with inaccurate license details (e.g. 1 user count) has logged into the system first and is locking out all other users. To confirm this, you could open the pastel company folder and search for the .LOC file. Open the .LOC file in notepad and you should see the name of the offending workstation. 
</p><p>
One way to avoid this is to use the Gateway Locator tool to assign ownership of the various Pastel Partner company databases to the server and to make sure that the server has the right license info.</p>
</p>

<img src="portfolio/images/blog/1612.png" alt="screenshot" />
<p>To do this, go to Start > All Programs > Other Utilities > Gateway Locator.
Click on the button at the end of the Target Directory textbox to browse to and select the appropriate pastel company database. Click on the change button and enter the server name in the “Assign a Gateway” field  and click “Ok”

        summary: "A persistent bug in Sage Evolution since version 10 allows duplicate invoice numbers even with manual numbering enabled. Here's a workaround using an SQL trigger.",
        content: `
            <p>If you’ve worked with Sage 200 Evolution or Sage 100 Evolution since version 10, you may have encountered a rather annoying bug: <strong>duplicate invoice numbering</strong>. Even when you’ve set your database to use <strong>manual invoice numbering</strong> and checked the option to disallow duplicates, the system can still sneakily allow duplicate invoice numbers.</p>
    
            <p>Here's a screenshot of the configuration option where the bug seems to take effect:  
            <img src="portfolio/images/blog/trigger.png" alt="Configuration option for disallowing duplicate invoice numbers"></p>
    
            <p>Frustrating, right? Even with subsequent updates, this issue persists. Over time, I realized I couldn’t keep waiting for Sage to fix it—I had to take matters into my own hands for the sake of my clients.</p>
    
            <p>So, I came up with a solution: a <strong>SQL trigger</strong> that ensures no duplicate invoice numbers are allowed when saving or posting an invoice. Let me walk you through the process.</p>
    
            <h3>How the Fix Works</h3>
            <p>The bug exists because the system doesn’t effectively validate invoice numbers when saving a document to the database. To counter this, I created a trigger on the <code>INVNUM</code> table (this is where Sage Evolution stores inventory-related documents, such as invoices).</p>
    
            <p>Here’s what the trigger does in simple terms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Focus on Incomplete Documents:</strong> The trigger works specifically for documents with <code>DocType = 0</code>. This indicates an unsaved or "fresh" document.</li>
                <li><strong>Check for Duplicates:</strong> When a new document is saved or updated, the trigger compares the <code>InvNumber</code> of the incoming row with existing records in the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Exclude Current Row:</strong> To ensure the system doesn’t falsely flag the row being processed, it excludes the current row from the check using the primary key (<code>AutoIndex</code> in this case).</li>
                <li><strong>Raise an Error if a Duplicate Exists:</strong> If duplicates are found, the trigger raises an error, prevents the document from saving, and rolls back the transaction.</li>
            </ol>
    
            <h3>The SQL Code</h3>
            <pre>
    <code>
    -- =============================================
    -- Author:      Akwasi Adu-Kyeremeh
    -- Create date: 27 August 2024
    -- Modified date: 28 August 2024
    -- Description: Check for existing Invoice Numbers to avoid duplicates when processing invoice where manual invoice numbering is enabled
    -- =============================================
    
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_CheckInvNumber
    ON INVNUM
    AFTER INSERT, UPDATE
    AS
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @ConflictCount INT;
    
        -- Check for duplicates only when DocType is 0, and exclude the inserted/updated rows themselves
        SELECT @ConflictCount = COUNT(*)
        FROM inserted i
        JOIN INVNUM n 
            ON i.InvNumber = n.InvNumber 
            AND i.DocType = 0 -- Ensure we are only checking for DocType 0
            AND n.DocType = 0 -- Ensure the comparison is only with DocType 0 rows
            AND n.AutoIndex != i.AutoIndex;  -- Replace with your primary key column to exclude the current row
    
        IF @ConflictCount > 0
        BEGIN
            RAISERROR ('Duplicate Invoice Number detected. Please check!', 16, 1);
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
        END
    END
    GO
    </code>
            </pre>
    
            <h3>Why This Works</h3>
            <p>By introducing this trigger, we ensure that the system performs the necessary validation at the database level. Even if Sage’s application logic fails to catch duplicates, this safety net ensures your records stay clean and consistent.</p>
    
            <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
            <p>This workaround isn’t perfect—it’s more of a patch than a permanent fix. Ideally, Sage should address this bug in future releases. But until they do, this solution has proven effective for my clients, and it might help you too!</p>

        <p>And it's rewriting the rules of work.</p>
        
        <p>From predictive insights to automated workflows, AI is fundamentally altering how ERP systems, business solutions, and software development are built and staffed.</p>
        
        <p>As someone who has implemented ERP systems across sectors, I'm seeing a shift: <strong>Companies aren't just adopting AI—they're reorganizing around it.</strong> That includes rethinking who does what, and which roles even exist.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World AI in ERP: What's Actually Changing</h3>
        <p>AI in ERP is no longer hypothetical. It's being deployed, now:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SAP S/4HANA</strong> uses machine learning to clear open receivables, reducing manual reconciliation.</li>
            <li><strong>Oracle ERP Cloud</strong> leverages AI for intelligent procurement and audit automation.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Copilot</strong> drafts emails, summarizes data, and suggests actions based on ERP records.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What It Means for ERP Professionals & Developers</h3>
        <p>The value chain is shifting from doing → directing → designing.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>ERP professionals now need <strong>AI and data literacy</strong>—not just module experience</li>
            <li>Developers are evolving into <strong>AI-integrating architects</strong>, not just coders</li>
            <li>Functional consultants must now <strong>connect AI tools with business strategy</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>But It's Not All Smooth Sailing</h3>
        <p>Yes, AI is powerful—but it's not plug-and-play.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data privacy & compliance</strong> challenges (GDPR, SOC2)</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy system integration</strong> and poor data quality</li>
            <li><strong>Over-reliance on automation</strong> without critical oversight</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is where human judgment matters most.</p>
        
        <h3>What Organizations Should Be Doing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Upskill ERP teams</strong> in AI concepts, data awareness, and solutioning</li>
            <li><strong>Shift roles</strong> from repetitive tasks to decision-support and governance</li>
            <li><strong>Double down on change management</strong>—not just tools, but people</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>What Professionals Can Do Now</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn how AI is being integrated into your stack (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, etc.)</li>
            <li>Understand data structure, flow, and governance</li>
            <li>Move from "execution" to <strong>strategy and insight</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>AI isn't coming. It's here. It's already reshaping roles, responsibilities, and entire workflows in ERP and enterprise tech.</p>
        
        <p>How are <em>you</em> adapting? What's changing in your industry?</p>

        categories: ["Business Central", "AL", "ERP", "Tips"],
        content: `
      <p>A friend on a Business Central-focused WhatsApp group I belong to asked this question:</p>
      
      <p><em>"Hi guys. Hoping y'all are doing great. Just a question... Is there anyone here who knows how to do bulk unapplication of customer invoices that are already tied to customer payments?"</em></p>
      
      <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong><br>
      Yes! In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you <strong>can</strong> unapply customer invoices that are already applied to payments — even in bulk — but the system doesn't natively support bulk unapplication through the standard UI. You’ll have to get creative. Here are a few approaches I shared:</p>
      
      <h3>Option 1: Manual Unapplication (Standard Way)</h3>
      <p>This is straightforward, but tedious if you’re dealing with more than a handful of records:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Go to <strong>Customer > Ledger Entries</strong>.</li>
      <li>Find the payment or invoice you want to unapply.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Process > Unapply Entries</strong>.</li>
      <li>Confirm unapplication.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It works, but it’s slow for high volumes.</p>
      
      <h3>Option 2: Use a Configuration Package (Advanced)</h3>
      <p>If you're feeling bold, you can technically unapply entries using a config package and Excel.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Create a config package and add table <code>379 - Detailed Cust. Ledg. Entry</code>.</li>
      <li>Export entries where <code>Applied Entry to Entry No.</code> &gt; 0.</li>
      <li>In Excel, clear the following fields: 
      <code>Applied Entry to Entry No.</code>, 
      <code>Application Type</code>, 
      <code>Application Date</code>.</li>
      <li>Import the Excel file back and apply the package.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> This method can cause inconsistencies if related fields (like <code>Amount Remaining</code>) are not recalculated properly. Use only in sandbox or with full data backups.</p>
      
      <h3>Option 3: AL Code for Safe Bulk Unapply</h3>
      <p>This is the cleanest way to handle bulk unapplication if you’re a developer or working with one.</p>
      
      <p>Here’s the core AL procedure I used:</p>
      <pre><code>
      procedure BulkUnapplyCustomerEntries(CustomerNo: Code[20])
      var
          CustLedgerEntry: Record "Cust. Ledger Entry";
          CustUnapply: Codeunit "CustUnapplyPostedEntries";
          UnappliedCount: Integer;
      begin
          UnappliedCount := 0;
          CustLedgerEntry.Reset();
          CustLedgerEntry.SetRange("Customer No.", CustomerNo);
          CustLedgerEntry.SetRange(Open, false);
          if CustLedgerEntry.FindSet() then
              repeat
                  if CustLedgerEntry."Applied Entries Exist" then begin
                      CustUnapply.Unapply(CustLedgerEntry);
                      UnappliedCount += 1;
                  end;
              until CustLedgerEntry.Next() = 0;
      
          Message('Successfully unapplied %1 entries for customer %2', UnappliedCount, CustomerNo);
      end;
      </code></pre>
      
      <p>I then wrapped this in a custom page so I could run it from the BC UI:</p>
      
      <h3>AL Page: Bulk Unapply from Customer List</h3>
      <p>This allows you to click a button on a customer and unapply all entries for that customer.</p>
      <pre><code>

          PageType = List;

      <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
      <p>If you only have a few entries, stick with the standard UI. For power users or mass cleanup, the AL extension route is safest. The config package trick should only be used if you know what you're doing — and never on production data without testing.</p>
      
      <p>Hope this helps someone else facing the same challenge! Cheers!</p>
